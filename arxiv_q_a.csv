utilizing the large body of existing wisdom, algorithms and technologies in the

What is the title of the research paper?,"Beyond Model Interpretability: Socio-Structural Explanations in Machine
  Learning"
What is this research paper about?,What is it to interpret the outputs of an opaque machine learning model.
What is this research paper about?,"One
approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques."
What is this research paper about?,"These
techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either
model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic
interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or
nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships."
What is this research paper about?,"In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine
learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing
to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation."
What is this research paper about?,"The
relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine
learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by
social structures."
What is this research paper about?,"Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social
structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning
models."
What is this research paper about?,"We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by
examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm."
What is this research paper about?,"Our proposal
highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability,
understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader
analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model
itself."

What is the title of the research paper?,Discussion on Mechanical Learning and Learning Machine
What is this research paper about?,"Mechanical learning is a computing system that is based on a set of simple

What is this research paper about?,"We propose 2 directions to
approach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to
realize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical
